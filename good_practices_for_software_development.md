## Review Questions

**Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?**

After reading the given practices for Software Development, there are a few new things I learned:

1. It's a good idea to use an app like Boosted to track my time and improve productivity.
2. Sometimes, it's not possible for my team members to talk on a call. In those cases, I can send them a message on Slack or WhatsApp. But instead of sending multiple messages, it's better to write down all my questions and send them in a single message.
3. I should keep my phone on silent and remove notifications from the home screen. It's best to only have notifications for work-related apps to avoid distractions.

**Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

I think I need to get better at managing my time and being more productive. To improve, I will prioritize tasks, set realistic deadlines, break tasks into smaller steps, minimize distractions, use time blocking, take regular breaks, and learn productivity techniques. By doing these things, I believe I can make progress in improving my time management and productivity.
