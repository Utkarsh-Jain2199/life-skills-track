## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

**Question 1**: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea from the video "Forget big change, start with a tiny habit: BJ Fogg at TEDxFremont" is the concept of starting small and building up slowly when trying to form new habits. Instead of making big changes all at once, the speaker suggests focusing on tiny habits that are easy to maintain. By shifting one component of a habit (cue, routine, or reward) slightly, we can begin our journey towards successful habit formation.

**Question 2**: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

To make forming new habits easier, remember B = MAP:

- **B** stands for Behavior: It's the habit I want to develop.
- **M** stands for Motivation: Increase our desire and motivation for the habit by aligning it with our goals and values.
- **A** stands for Ability: Make the habit easier to do by breaking it down into smaller steps or removing obstacles.
- **P** stands for Prompt: Use cues or reminders to prompt and trigger the habit.

**Question 3**: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

It is important to "shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit because celebration reinforces the behavior and increases the likelihood of it becoming a habit. When we celebrate our successes, our brain releases dopamine, a feel-good chemical that reinforces the behavior and creates a positive association with it. This positive reinforcement strengthens the habit loop and motivates us to repeat the behavior in the future. By celebrating after each successful completion of a habit, we are more likely to continue and solidify that habit over time.

**Question 4**: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting story or idea in the video is the concept of "the aggregation of marginal gains" presented through Dave Brailsford's story. Brailsford transformed British Cycling by implementing small 1% improvements in every aspect of the team's performance, leading to significant success. This idea highlights the power of making small improvements and developing positive habits, as they can compound over time and lead to great achievements.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits

**Question 5**: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book "Atomic Habits" emphasizes the importance of identity in habit formation. It suggests that focusing on who we want to become (our desired identity) rather than solely on the outcome or goal helps in establishing lasting habits. By aligning our habits with our desired identity, we can create a sense of self that naturally gravitates towards the behaviors that support that identity.

**Question 6**: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

According to "Atomic Habits," making a habit easier to do involves two key strategies. First, it suggests making the habit more attractive by linking it to something enjoyable or rewarding. This can be done by adding a positive element or creating a satisfying environment around the habit. Second, the book emphasizes the importance of making the habit easier to start by reducing the friction or barriers associated with it. By breaking the habit down into smaller, manageable steps and removing obstacles, it becomes easier to initiate and maintain.

**Question 7**: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

The book suggests several strategies to make a habit harder to do. One approach is to increase the friction or difficulty associated with the habit. This can be done by adding steps or obstacles that make it less convenient or appealing to engage in the habit. Another strategy is to create accountability by involving others or publicly committing to the habit. By making the habit more challenging or adding external pressures, it becomes harder to deviate from the desired behavior.

## 5. Reflection

**Question 8**: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and/or response satisfying?

Playing chess is one of my habits that I would like to do more. To play more chess games:

1. Make it obvious: Set a specific time or schedule for playing chess and keep chess-related items visible.
2. Make it attractive: Find a chess partner or join a club, try different game formats, and set goals or challenges.
3. Make it satisfying: Celebrate victories, track progress, and reward myself after playing chess games.

By implementing these steps, I can make playing chess games a more prominent and enjoyable habit in my routine.

**Question 9**: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

Overuse of a smartphone is one of my habits that I would like to eliminate or do less. To reduce smartphone usage:

1. Make the cue invisible: Hide notifications and keep my phone out of sight.
2. Make the habit unattractive: Remind myself of the negative consequences and engage in more fulfilling activities.
3. Make the process harder: Set passcodes and use app blockers to limit access.
4. Make the response unsatisfying: Reflect on negative feelings and find alternative sources of satisfaction.

By implementing these steps, I can make it easier to reduce or eliminate excessive smartphone usage and replace it with more fulfilling activities.
