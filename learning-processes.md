# Learning Process

## Question 1
**What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.**
The Feynman Technique is a learning method that involves explaining a concept in simple terms to ensure a solid understanding.

## Question 2
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**
According to me, the most interesting idea is about how to deal with procrastination. There are two ways to handle this: either keep working through it or turn your attention away.

1. Break the skill down into manageable pieces.
2. Learn enough to practice and self-correct.
3. Remove barriers to practice.
4. Practice for at least 20 hours.

## Question 5
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**
After watching the videos and reading the content shared with us, I will take some actions to improve my learning process:
1. I will set simple targets and have clear goals.
2. I will use all my senses (seeing, hearing, reading, or doing things) to learn better.
3. I will try to break down big things to learn into smaller, easier parts.
4. I will apply the Feynman Technique, which involves learning concepts in simple terms as if teaching them to someone else, to improve my learning.
5. I will practice regularly, giving my best effort in every task.
